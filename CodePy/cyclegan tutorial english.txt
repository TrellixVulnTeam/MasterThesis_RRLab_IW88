1. 
- Under the following link you can find the unedited "original" network.
there is also explained how the folder structure etc. has to be done. 
- As input it takes pictures from Domain A (Source domain) and about as many pictures from Domain B (Target domain). 
    
https://github.com/xhujoy/CycleGAN-tensorflow

You have to make sure that you have the "original picture" from domain A 
mapped output image. (This may be a lot of work)

2.
The following modules are required for the following processing:
- Mean Image of the output of 1. as well as the Mean Image of the domain A

- Masks for the interesting objects (Pedestrians ...) from Domain A
- The masks have to be assigned to the source domain and the mapped images 
      so that you can insert the objects back into the mapped images.
- Original Source Domain images to extract the interesting objects


3. Faster R-CNN is I think clear, right?
Data sets
There is the problem that I have not saved all the records, there are
but data records from intermediate steps. I leave those, with which I imagine 
can be interesting for you in the zip file:
- for the annotations
    to create the tfrecords
- pure mapped city
    JPEGImages_city23
    JPEGImages_city37
- mixed dataset with unreal persons (Here are also the pictures in it, which I call
"final result". Unfortunately, I lack the pure data set for it.
    JPEGImages_mixedorigpersons


Example python scripts
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) process_images.py
    - There is programmed exemplarily, the persons with the mask from the 
    Original image can be placed in the mapped image (not with 100% intensity), 
    because then the result would be worse) etc.. (processing pipeline)
2) map_persons_to_mapped_city23.py
    - Pure mapping of people into mapped images
3) tf_record_builder.py
    - This can be used to create tfrecords
4) evaluation_stuff.py
    - This can be used to create among other things the Mean Images
5) mean_diff.py
    - I have mapped the images with the original images with this script 
    are assigned to the It calculates the similarity of images.

I think those were the main scripts
